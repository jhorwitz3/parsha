# parsha

An app to inform about this week's torah reading.

## Getting Started
TODOS:
1. Utilize this API in backend to determine what parsha is it: https://www.hebcal.com/home/4277/leyning-torah-reading-api
2. Build out tabbed screens: description, characters, and commentary (start with just description and characters)
3. Get commentary sources - continue w/ AI probably (lazy)
4. Build app and upload to app stores
5. Build weekly push notification on Friday
